Legacy systems are outdated systems with degraded architecture, obsolete features, and inefficient technologies. To stay competitive in today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, organizations must modernize their legacy systems and update them to integrate with modern technologies. However, the modernization process presents significant challenges, as it requires tedious manual refactoring tasks, often further complicated by the lack of proper documentation and the unavailability of the original developers. To address these challenges, we propose the RefactorAI project, which focuses on developing an AI-integrated methodology and tool to assist developers in the refactoring tasks associated with legacy systems. The proposed approach leverages the strengths of AI, in particular Generative AI (GenAI) in combination with existing modernization approaches, while incorporating human oversight to limit the drawbacks of AI, such as LLM hallucinations. By integrating AI into the refactoring process, we aim to significantly reduce the time and cost associated with modernization efforts, while also mitigating the risks of technical debt and system vulnerability. The outcomes of RefactorAI are expected to contribute to economic, social, and ecological sustainability by making software systems more efficient, reducing technical debt, and facilitating the adoption of new technologies.
