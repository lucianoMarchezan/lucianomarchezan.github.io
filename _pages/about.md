My name is Luciano Marchezan de Paula. I am currently a Post Doctoral Researcher at the [Institute of Software Systems Engineering (ISSE)](https://isse.jku.at/) at the [Johannes Kepler University Linz (JKU)](https://jku.at/). I obtained my Ph.D. diploma at the [Institute of Software Systems Engineering (ISSE)](https://isse.jku.at/) at the [Johannes Kepler University Linz (JKU)](https://jku.at/). I obtained my Master's and my Bachelor's degrees in Software Engineering in the [Laboratory of Empirical Studies in Software Engineering (LESSE)](https://lesse.com.br/site/) at the [Federal University of Pampa (UNIPAMPA)](https://unipampa.edu.br/alegrete/). My research interests include Model-Driven Software Engineering, Automated Software Engineering, Software Reuse, and Empirical Software Engineering.

My Ph.D. research (concluded in 2023) explored the maintenance of consistency across engineering artifacts in collaborative environments as well as the recording and maintenance of the change history of languages and their instances. 


From my research findings, I was able to publish [scientific papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=26yB7xkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in different Software Engineering conferences (ICSE, SANER, ICSME, ESEM, EASE, ICSSP/ICGSE, SPLC, among others) and Journals (JSS, EMSE, SoSym, SPE, IET Software, among others).
