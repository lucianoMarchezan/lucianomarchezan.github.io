   abstract = {Engineering projects involve a variety of artifacts such as requirements, design, or source code. These artifacts, many of which tend to be interdependent, are often manipulated concurrently. To keep artifacts consistent, engineers must continuously consider their work in relation to the work of multiple other engineers. Traditional consistency checking approaches reason efficiently over artifact changes and their consistency implications. However, they do so solely within the boundaries of specific tools and their specific artifacts (e.g., consistency checking between different UML models). This makes it difficult to examine the consistency between different types of artifacts (e.g., consistency checking between UML models and the source code). Global consistency checking can help addressing this problem. However, it usually requires a disruptive and time-consuming merging process for artifacts. This article presents a novel, cloud-based approach to global consistency checking in a multi-developer/-tool engineering environment. It allows for global consistency checking across all artifacts that engineers work on concurrently. Moreover, it reasons over artifact changes immediately after the change happened, while keeping the (memory/CPU) cost of consistency checking minimal. The feasibility and scalability of our approach were demonstrated by a prototype implementation and through an empirical validation.},

   abstract = {Software line (SPL) scoping aids companies to define the boundaries of their resources such as products, domains, and assets, the target of reuse tasks scoping technical and organizational aspects. As scoping guides the management of the resources in SPL development, it becomes one of the core activities in this process. We can find in the literature several approaches on this topic, proposing techniques and methodologies to be applicable in different organizational scenarios. However, no work comprehensively reviews such approaches and describes the advances in state of the art in the last years. In this context, we look into identifying, analyzing, and extracting detailed characteristics from SPL scoping proposals found in the literature. These characteristics allowed us to compare these approaches, reason about their applicability, and identify existing limitations and research opportunities. Thus, we conducted a systematic literature review alongside snowballing, following a well-defined protocol to retrieve, classify and extract information from the literature. We analyzed a total of 58 studies, identifying 41 different approaches in the field, highlighting their similarities and differences, and establishing a generic scoping process. Furthermore, we discuss research opportunities in the SPL scoping field.},

   abstract = {There are many repair alternatives for resolving model inconsistencies, each involving one or more model changes. Enumerating them all could overwhelm the developer because the number of possible repairs can grow exponentially. To address this problem, this paper focuses on the immediate cause of an inconsistency. By focusing on the cause, we can generate a repair tree with a subset of repair actions focusing on fixing this cause. This strategy identifies model elements that must be repaired, as opposed to additional model elements that may or may not have to be repaired later. Furthermore, our approach can provide an ownership-based filter for filtering repairs that modify model elements not owned by a developer. This filtering can further reduce the repair possibilities, aiding the developer when choosing repairs to be performed. We evaluated our approach on 24 UML models and four Java systems, using 17 UML consistency rules and 14 Java consistency rules. The evaluation data contained 39,683 inconsistencies, showing our approach’s usability as the repair trees sizes ranged from five to nine on average per model. Also, these repair trees were generated in 0.3 seconds on average, showing our approach’s scalability. Based on the results, we discuss the correctness and minimalism with regard to the cause of the inconsistency. Lastly, we evaluated the filtering mechanism, showing that it is possible to further reduce the number of repairs generated by focusing on ownership.},

   abstract = {Domain-specific languages (DSL) are programming or modeling languages devoted to a given application domain. There are many tools used to support the implementation of a DSL, making hard the decision-making process for one or another. In this sense, identifying and mapping their features is relevant for decision-making by academic and industrial initiative on DSL development. Objective: The goal of this work is to identify and map the tools, Language Workbenches (LW), or frameworks that were proposed to develop DSLs discussed and referenced in publications between 2012 and 2019. Method: A Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) of the literature scoping tools for DSL development. Results: We identified 59 tools, including 9 under a commercial license and 41 with non-commercial licenses, and analyzed their features from 230 papers. Conclusion: There is a substantial amount of tools that cover a large number of features. Furthermore, we observed that usually, the developer adopts one type of notation to implement the DSL: textual or graphical. We also discuss research gaps, such as a lack of tools that allow meta-meta model transformations and that support modeling tools interoperability.},

   abstract = {Every year several contributions to the model-based testing (MBT) field are published. Therefore, to follow the evolution and trends of several tools and models available is difficult. Moreover, since the variety of models and tools that became available in recent years, choosing an approach to support the MBT process is a challenging activity. The main objective of this study is to provide an overview on MBT tools and models used by those tools. Furthermore, the authors' study can help academic researchers and companies to understand the topics involving MBT. Therefore, a systematic mapping study was conducted in which 1197 distinct papers were evaluated. At the end, 87 primary studies were selected to be analysed in a quantitative and qualitative way. As a result, they classified the tools and models that are currently used to support MBT. Moreover, they identified 70 MBT tools, as well as different domains in which MBT is already applied to. Therefore, there are some evidence that MBT continues to be a broad and 'alive' research field since every year a significant number of papers presenting different kinds of contributions are published.},

abstract = {Repairing design models is a laborious task that requires a considerable amount of time and effort from developers. Repair recommendation (RR) approaches focus on reducing the effort and improving the quality of the repairs performed. Such approaches have been evaluated in terms of scalability, correctness, and minimalism. These evaluations, however, have not investigated how developers can benefit from using RRs and how they perceive the difficulty of applying RRs. Investigating and discussing the use of RRs from the developers’ perspective is important to demonstrate the benefits of applying such approaches in practice. We explore this opportunity by conducting a controlled experiment carried out with 24 developers where they repaired UML design models in eight different tasks, with and without RRs. The findings indicate that developers can benefit from RRs in complex tasks by improving their effectiveness and efficiency. The results also evidence that the use of RRs does not impact the developers’ perceived difficulty and confidence when repairing models. Furthermore, our findings show that not all developers choose the same RR, but rather, have varied preferences. Thus, the provision of RRs leads to developers considering additional alternatives to repair an inconsistency.},
